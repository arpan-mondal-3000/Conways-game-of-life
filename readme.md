# Conway's Game of Life

It is a simulation of Conway's game of life with python using the pygame library to render the game. It is a automation of a cellular system with certain rules and a zero-player game.

## Rules of Conway's Game of Life

### 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

### 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

### 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

### 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
